# About Machine Learning and Data Science
**Machine Learning** is an approach to try and achieve Artificial Intelligence through systems that can find patterns in a set of data. Stanford University describes Machine Learning as the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed, that is getting machines to do things  without us specifically saying “Do this, then do that, then do this!”.
The field of **Data Science** simply means analysing data, looking at data and then doing something with it. 
Both Machine Learning and Data Science overlap and relate and we can’t do one without the other because we need to be able to understand data and work with data to do Machine Learning.

# How Machine Learning works?
In order to teach a machine something we need to give it the input (all the data that we have) and what output we want to be (what the answer is), then instead of us writing the function the machine generates the function/model/algorithm/bot. 
The only reason that we care about Machine Learning is that we are able to use machines to **predict** results based on incoming data.

# Description
You could find here a Machine Learning model that can detect types of the Iris Plant using the dataset from Scikit-Learn. The model was created based on the six steps: Import the data, Clean the data (I assumed that the data is already clean), Split the data (Training/Test Set), Create a Model, Check the output, Improve.

# How can you run it?
You should simply install **Jupyter Notebook**.
Copy the **IrisIdentifier.ipynb** file into your local computer.
Open it with Jupyter Notebook and enter some numbers in Line [7], variable “**sample**” based on each parameter of the dataset (Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width) to predict which type of Iris is.
Note that the model has 97.77% prediction accuracy.
